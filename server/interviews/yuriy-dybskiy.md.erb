**Sacha Greif:** I'm here with [Yuriy Dybskiy](https://twitter.com/html5cat) from Meteor. Today, we're going to talk about *community*. Not the TV show but actually the Meteor community, and especially Meteor Day. 

First of all, can you introduce yourself and what you do at Meteor?

**Yuriy Dybskiy:** Sure. Sacha, I'm honored to be here, real pleasure. My official title is community engineer. I'll dig a little deeper on what that entails. A little bit of background: I used to live in Ukraine. I lived in Japan, then Canada, and now San Francisco.

I started coding as a kid. Then, I took a lot of math courses in the university. I have a masters in Mathematics. Then, I got into software engineering and Web development.

I stayed there for almost the last 10 years, mostly front end. The last five years, I've been working with Canadian and US start-ups. Last year, I switched to a new role which was developer advocacy.

<%= pullquote "The first talk I gave about Meteor was in August 2012.", "wide" %>

About five or six months ago, I joined Meteor as a community engineer. I've been part of the community for more than two years now actually. The first talk I gave about Meteor was in August 2012. That's two years and a couple of months. That's my story of getting into the Meteor community.

### How To Land Your Dream Job

**Sacha:** When did you join Meteor?

**Yuriy:** I joined Meteor in June 2014.

**Sacha:** So fairly recently. I'd be curious to know how these couple months have been. What's your report on working for Meteor?

**Yuriy:** First, I'll back track a little bit because I've been giving talks about Meteor for the last two years or so. I've given talks in Vancouver, Portland, Seattle, and Buenos Aires and San Francisco. I've been a captain of all those groups.

**Sacha:** So in a way you were already working for Meteor?

**Yuriy:** [laughs] Yeah. I've been knocking on this Meteor door for almost two years. It was really funny how in June, except for getting a Meteor email account, almost nothing changed in terms of my day-to-day work. I was still part of the community. I was still helping grow the community.

<%= pullquote "I've been knocking on this Meteor door for almost two years.", "wide" %>

I was just doing more of that. It's really interesting how my role hasn't changed much in terms of community building, which just shows how much you can contribute, being on the outside of Meteor as a company, to Meteor as a movement and as a project.

We also recently had Robert join with the community team. He has helped me out with the speaker program. Alice is also now in the community team which is really awesome.

**Sacha:** I guess this is interesting because the usual way people find a job is they apply to four or five jobs. They do interviews and so on. But you started doing the job you wanted to do even *before* you had the job in a way. I think that's pretty cool.

**Yuriy:** I think it's an interesting change. It happens more and more in different companies. It's like you start doing what you want to be doing and then you find the company that wants to support you and pay you to do that. It's a very interesting way to get a job. It was a good experiment actually.

<%= figure "interviews/yuriy-devshop.jpg", "Yuriy at a devshop" %>

### Engineering Communities

**Sacha:** Definitely. You mentioned something I find pretty interesting which is that your job title is community engineer. Why engineer? Why not manager? Why engineer specifically?

**Yuriy:** That's a great question. I'm a developer. I'm not a very good developer that's why I'm doing community engineering. But I like to code and I like to build things. I want to keep it that way.

If you ever played Team Fortress 2, it's a nice multi-player shooting game. There are different characters there. There's an engineer which always was my favorite character. I have most of the points and time played in Team Fortress as an engineer.

The question I asked myself, how can I become a more productive developer? Just as one developer, I can only so much. But if I can help a lot of people become developers or grow their technical skills or become better with tools, that will enhance the overall productivity a lot.

<%= pullquote "If you point the community in the right direction, it will create something amazing.", "wide" %>

I thought I'd try out this role. It basically involves building tools for the community and allowing the community to grow by itself because there's only so much I can do.

But if you point the community in the right direction, it will create something amazing. Meteor Day that happened recently is a really great example of what can happen with that in mind.

### “Community Hacking”

**Sacha:** Right now a very popular term is “growth hacking”. That's applying engineering to marketing or applying engineering to growth. What you're doing is applying engineering to community.

**Yuriy:** I never quite liked the growth hacking terms or some of those strategies. There are some really good strategies. There's always like SEO optimizations. Pretty much in any optimizations, there's this white hat techniques and black hat techniques.

Sometimes, those techniques are really good. Sometimes, they become very spammy. I always prefer the organic approaches and the natural growth of things and just creating conditions where amazing things can happen. Usually, they do happen if you make those conditions right.

**Sacha:** You're not using black hat community engineering tactics to...

**Yuriy:** Not yet.

**Sacha:** ...trick people into coming into the meet-ups.

Yuriy: [laughs] I would be curious to know what techniques are available, but so far now, it's been really just natural growth and writing a lot of emails. I don't know if that's hacking, but writing a lot of email and talking to people is really helpful to make things happen.

### Why Meteor Day

**Sacha:** You just mentioned Meteor Day. That was last week actually. Can you give us a quick report? First of all, what was Meteor Day for people who are watching [or reading] this from the future? How did it go?

**Yuriy:** [laughs] To people watching this from the future, on October 28th, Meteor launched version 1.0 of the framework and the platform. Funny enough, it coincided with my birthday. It's very easy for me to remember when Meteor 1.0 landed.

As part of the launch, the idea was to get people together to show them what Meteor 1.0 is. A lot of people were playing with Meteor for the last two years. A lot of things have changed. Some of the rough edges have been polished.

There are so many apps and example apps now that are new. There are only two example apps but they're so good that it was really worth getting attention towards it. We decided we should try to coordinate as several cities to come together to celebrate that.

<%= figure "interviews/todos.jpg", "The new to-dos example app.", "none", "http://meteor.com/" %>

Then, we thought, "What if we try to get all our groups to meet on the same day? Wouldn't that be amazing?" Our goal was to get together 70 cities. That was a really ambitious goal because I don't think an open source, something like this has ever happened.

There's been Node Day and Node School Days which are really amazing programs. But I don't think they have ever had more than 40 or 20 something cities joined together. A goal of 70 cities was really ambitious.

We started preparing for that and planning that out. Then, once we started announcing, more and more cities started to jump on board.

### Connecting In Real Life

**Yuriy:** There have been so many new cities popping out that wanted to host an event. Also, almost all of the cities that have currently meet-up groups in their cities had a Meteor event, got together, and were playing with the Meteor 1.0.

Another interesting thing, one of the other things we wanted to do is, how do you connect people around the world with the core developers of Meteor? Because they're really busy building a framework.

It's really hard to get a hold of them. But we really wanted to put them in front of people who are using Meteor and for them to be able to talk to each other and ask questions.

<%= figure "interviews/meteorday.jpg", "Meteor Day", "none", "http://meteorday.com/" %>

The idea was to have a live hangout between the cities and the core developers. We managed to get that working as well. We used [Talky.io](https://talky.io/) which is really a great product for video conferencing. We had up to five or six cities join per room. We had our core developers answering all of the questions.

It was really exciting. It was 24 hours of rolling events. Almost like a New Year's celebration except it was a Meteor Day celebration at the same local time events happened all over the world. 134 cities is the last count.

<%= pullquote "More than 4,000 people came together on Monday, which is truly amazing.", "wide" %>

**Sacha:** Wow.

**Yuriy:** According to RSVPs, there were 4,259 RSVPs through meetup.com. Also, some of the events were using Facebook and Google+. I don't think we counted that yet. It's more than 4,000 people came together on Monday which is truly amazing.


**Sacha:** It is. Does that count people who are watching online?

**Yuriy:** We had an online meet-up as part of San Francisco group. Only a hundred people signed up for that. The goal for this particular event was to include as many people locally to get them to meet the local Meteor developers.

It was much more optimized for getting to know people, meeting people in your city and then Skyping or seeing a Meteor core developer rather than just watching it live stream.

<%= figure "interviews/meteorday-checkin.jpg", "Meteor Day Check-in", "none", "http://meteorday.meteor.com/" %>

For the future ones, we will consider having a pure online, really a combination of online/offline events and have more focus on the online so people from even the more extreme north locations could join and participate.

**Sacha: **That makes sense. That's still 4,000 real people walking out of their home and going to a meet-up for Meteor, it's really amazing.

**Yuriy:** It's really amazing. On Twitter, the reaction was amazing. There were a lot of photos. I'll do a round up look. It should be probably out by the time you see the video.

### The Aftermath

**Sacha:** Are things different after Meteor Day? Have you noticed more activity, more questions?

**Yuriy:** Yeah. We're still just one week, less than a week after Meteor Day. I've been sleeping most of the time because it was so tiring preparing such event and coordinating so many cities. One thing that all the captains have said is that they were amazed at how many people showed up at their event in their city.

Some of the captains have been running events for almost two years. For Meteor Day, they had record attendance in every single city around the world. It was phenomenal. The reaction is phenomenal.

We're going to do round-up blog post, but we're also going to build some infrastructure around better ways of showcasing the projects that have been built and have been demoed during Meteor Day.

Right now, they're in GitHub repo worldwide Meteor Day. You can submit a pull request and showcase your project there if you're interested.

### Getting The Word Out

**Sacha:** That's interesting. So how did you manage to get the word out before Meteor Day to achieve such a high turnout?

**Yuriy:** We set the specific date of the Meteor Day months in advance, which is pretty short notice, maybe a little bit more. I need to double-check the exact timelines.

Basically, the thing that governed the Meteor Day event was, we set a date and we told people, "Hey, this is the date where you'll be able to come together and meet up".

Due to press limitations, we couldn't say that that's going to be related to Meteor 1.0. It was actually pretty tricky to market the event without telling exactly what it's going to be.

On one hand, it could have lowered the numbers because not everybody knew what's actually going to happen. On the other hand, the mystery may have attracted a lot of people.

<%= pullquote "It was just about getting everybody together and seeing what has been built with Meteor.", "wide" %>

Basically what they were seeing is that, this is going to be a worldwide Meteor Day to celebrate Meteor community. There was no mentioning of Meteor 1.0. It was just about getting everybody together and seeing what has been built with Meteor.

Then, people saw that the release candidates were being shipped on the Meteor repo. They were starting to get the idea that it's going to be probably around 1.0 but we couldn't confirm and deny that.

As much as Meteor is an incredibly open company, there's very little information outside that there is inside the company that is not available outside. This was the specific date for some press releases and everything is needed to be kept secret. We couldn't announce that it's going to be 1.0.

### A Different Community

**Sacha:** What I keep wondering about is, first of all, is the Meteor community different because from the inside, it feels like it's a really tight-knit and a very active community.

Are you doing something different from other frameworks like angular or just node? If so, what is it? Is it coming from the way Meteor is structured? Is it a top-down thing? Is it something you're doing? I'm curious to know.

**Yuriy:** Great question. First of all, there's the nature of Meteor as a project itself, it self-selects people that are interested in slightly different things.

<%= pullquote "Usually, people in the Meteor community are focused on building an app.", "wide" %>

Usually, people in Meteor community are focused on building an app. They value the different options. They check out Meteor. They realized how useful it is and how much it brings to the table in terms of efficiency.

They decided to trust us as Meteor developers, as Meteor core developers, to make a lot of technical decisions for them to make their lives easier and focus on building things rather than focus on making sure that those technology pieces play nicely together.

Meteor is a full stack solution. I've given a lot of talks introducing Meteor. It's always different crowds respond differently to different things. Since you're watching this, you're probably interested in Meteor and you want to learn it.

It seems to bring a lot of people who are curious how to better build apps. That makes it just this unspoken, I guess. We should actually do a better job of communicating our values. That's one of the things that I'll start working on very soon.

But basically, it just naturally happened to bring people that are curious about better way to build things. It unites right away and focuses people on how to build stuff rather than figuring out how to get it working.

<%= figure "interviews/meteorday.gif", "Meteor Day animated" %>

**Sacha:** I guess it's more motivating to talk about building actual stuff rather than implementation details.

**Yuriy:** There are still a lot to talk about the implementation details on how you do it and how to use specific packages. There's still a lot of that.

I guess also, people are always on the same page in terms of this stack. That's interesting differentiation because you go to node or you go to angular meet-ups. I've been to a lot of them. The uniting part is there like the angular for example or node.

But there are so many different use cases. There are so many different other parts of the system that not a lot of people are together on the same page in that regard.

While when people come to Meteor meet-up, when they're at the Meteor event and you're using Meteor, there's this foundation level which everybody is on the same page. It gets this feeling of union and being united together.

**Sacha:** Also, just the fact that Meteor is doing something different from what everybody else is doing. There's a feeling that we're at the forefront of a new movement. That's very motivating as well.

**Yuriy:** Definitely. It's very new. One of the ways to look at Meteor is, if you stop looking at building a Web app as a Web app or a website and you start looking at it as a distributed system, because you have a server and you have a lot of clients and they're basically all nodes and you're syncing data between them.

Once you start looking at it through the lens of distributed systems, which I recently started to do, then you realize how powerful this is and how that's actually the way things are going to get built.

<%= pullquote "They have to basically build most of Meteor from scratch.", "wide" %>

A lot of people are coming to this conclusion. They have to basically build most of Meteor from scratch when they're building a collaborative app or something, or multiple people update at the same time.

### The Year Of Meteor

**Sacha:** Cool. We've covered a lot of ground on what happened in the last couple of months. Now, I want to talk about what's coming for 2015. What are your plans in terms of community and events? Is there anything you can share?

**Yuriy:** Sure. Definitely. 1.0 is the readiness of framework signals to a lot of people. Before 1.0, people who play with Meteor were pretty adventurous usually. With 1.0 standpoint Meteor framework, which was actually pretty ready a few months beforehand, but there's an API for it. It's much more stable.

Now, it's a question, how do you grow the package ecosystem? How do you grow the community further? There's a lot more people with the news launch and everything. There's a lot more people who are interested about Meteor and who have used Meteor for a long time.

It's a process when the framework matures. It's very interesting. I think Node hit it at some point. They still officially didn't become 1.0, but there are so many production-ready apps. It's going to happen with Meteor really, really soon.

### What Meteor & Tango Have In Common

**Yuriy:** The plans for 2015 are to have more regular meet-ups in all the cities. My grand vision comes from my hobby which is Argentine tango.

An interesting thing about Argentine tango is that you can go to any city in the world. You can come to an event, a tango event, and you can meet people, you can dance together once you've reached a certain level of competency in tango.

<%= pullquote "My grand vision comes from my hobby, which is Argentine tango.", "wide" %>

It will be really awesome to have something similar for Meteor where regardless of where you are in the world, every month or maybe more often in some cities like bigger cities, people would come together and show the projects that they've been building, socialize, and share their experience. That's basically one of my goals.

If you look at it, it's how do you scale education? How do you share knowledge and make it more efficient? Online courses are an amazing thing. There's a lot of material that needs to be covered by online, by books, by videos, by screencast. There's a lot of that.

But also, it's really important to meet people. For me, being able to, regardless to where you live, meet other developers that are using Meteor is a really great experience and very fulfilling and feels good. It's what I'm going to be working towards.

**Sacha:** Awesome. I'm looking forward to seeing what 2015 brings for Meteor. It's going to be an exciting year. Let's catch up again maybe in a couple of months so we can see what happened.

**Yuriy:** Definitely. I think 2015 is going to be year of Meteor. We'll see a lot of amazing things coming out. Stay tuned for that. Thank you very much, Sacha, for this interview.

**Sacha:** Thanks, Yuriy!

*Thanks a ton to Yuriy for making himself available and sharing Meteor's upcoming plans!*
